# Using Data Science to help prevent problems on your flights
## Project Description

Have you ever had a flight where your seat won't recline? Or the bathroom was closed? Or even a delay that was justified through unexpected maintenance problems that had to be solved before the aircraft could leave the airport? All of this situations are related to the aircraft maintenance process.
Maintenance is one of the biggest cost factors for operating business aircraft. To ensure safety and availability, owners and operators should not cut corners to try to save money. Maintenance experts discuss these issues and their ideas to help manage maintenance costs, especially given the shortage of skilled technicians. This project aimed to conduct some analysis and visualization to outline where the most problems are to then try to implement solutions to improve the process.

## Files
1.Aircraft_Maintenance_EDA: contains the analysis and visualization of the aircrafts data.
2. data_test.csv: contains the dataset, to model and analysis on aircrafts and faults.

## Results
Simply by performing EDA on the dataset we’ve identified some interesting results. Identifying all the main detractors enables many other possibilities to all the processes that evolve around aircraft maintenance. On the other hand, it’s possible to delve more into this data to get more insights and even try to model to predict when an equipment will fail. For the time being an EDA was enough to understand where the biggest problem lays and initiate changes in those processes to get a better solution on open faults.

## Requirements
Anaconda, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and StringIO
